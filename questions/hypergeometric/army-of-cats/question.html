      In a drawer in a kitchen there are <b>{{params.N}}</b> cans of cat food of the same shape and size. <b>{{params.total_F}}</b> are labeled Fish and
      Shrimp Feast (F) and <b>{{params.total_B}}</b> are labeled Beef Feast in Gravy (B). Unfortunately, a pot of coffee was spilled over the
      contents of the drawer and this rendered the labels unreadable. Because the labels are now unreadable the
      human resident of the household at feeding time takes <b>{{params.n}}</b> random cat food cans from the drawer to feed the
      army of cats living in the household. Answer the two questions that follow. <u>(Answers to four decimal places,
      ten-thousandths.)</u>
