# Save My EE 381 Grade

This repository is PrairieLearn course that students in EE 381 - Probability and Statistics with Applications to Computing at CSULB can use to study.
Anyone with access to the repository is able to add question for other students to practice with, creating an easy way to collaborate with a study group.
The advantage of a PrairieLearn course to other study websites is that students have more freedom when creating questions, can implement randomization to
many varients of the same base problem, and organize study questions by topics using tags.

## Running the Course

Create a local repository and follow the directions on the [PrairieLearn](https://prairielearn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installing/) website to run the course on your device.
To actually realize the final product, we would need to create a server that runs the course for easier and faster access. This is outside the scope  of
the project for now.
